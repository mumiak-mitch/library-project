# Library Project

A simple library project to manage and display a collection of books using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project allows users to add, remove, and toggle the read status of books in their virtual library. The user interface includes a "NEW BOOK" button that opens a form to input book details, and a display area for the library with options to interact with each book.

## Features

- **Add Book:** Users can add new books to the library by filling out a form with details such as title, author, pages, and read status.

- **Display Books:** The library displays each book with information such as title, author, pages, and read status. Books are shown in a card-like format.

- **Remove Book:** Each book card has a "Remove" button that allows users to remove the corresponding book from the library.

- **Toggle Read Status:** Users can toggle the read status of each book using the "Toggle Read Status" button on the book card.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the "NEW BOOK" button to add books to the library.
3. View and interact with the displayed books, including removing and toggling read status.
